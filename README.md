# Archived - Obsolete now

I've decided to archive this repo since RollingRock has gotten much further progress on the same mod, I will do further work on a fork of his branch.  

# VREngineFixes

Branch of Engine Fixes for SkyrimVR 1.4.15
Only supporting the Bad memory use and max stdio fixes right now. 
Requires special case build settings for SKSEVR - set platform v142 because of C++17 requirements from CommonLib code, which was partially ported for this.

Also credit to aers for supporting the SE build and helping me out with this!
